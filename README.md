# sfxandrun
This contains scripts that help setup and build package that use 7z sfx and execution feature

Windows scripts work on Windows. Debian scripts work on Ubuntu/Debian.

Both can build packages that run on Windows.

# Usage
Run the initial script first to set everything up.
Put packages in packages directory. By default package\runner.bat runs after extraction but that can be changed in build script...
